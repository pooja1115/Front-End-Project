                Sula Vineyards (or "Sula") is a winery and vineyard located in the Nashik region of western India, 180 km northeast of Mumbai. It was founded by Rajeev Samant in 1999.
                 Sula has grown to be India’s largest and most awarded wine brand. 
                 Sula introduced grape varietals such as Chenin blanc, Sauvignon blanc, Riesling and Zinfandel in India and is the leading player in the Indian wine industry.
                Sula Vineyards was founded by Mr. Rajeev Samant in the late 1990s.
                 An alumnus of Stanford University, he worked at Oracle in California after his graduation. After quitting his corporate job, Mr. Samant established Sula upon his return to India.
Sula was named after Samant's mother – 'Sulabha'. Samant steadily grew the company over the next few years by introducing newer grape varieties and expanding the company's offerings.
Over the last few decades, the Nashik region has transformed and is often referred to as "India’s Napa Valley".
